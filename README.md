# Netflix-Analysis-(EDA) 
Objective:
The objective of this project is to leverage Power BI to analyze Netflix data, extract meaningful insights, and create interactive visualizations for stakeholders.

1. Data Collection and Preparation:

Acquired Netflix data from kaggle dataset.

Cleaned and preprocess the data using tools like Excel or Power Query to ensure it's ready for analysis.

2. User Behavior Analysis:

Analyze show and movie rating and amount of films and television shows released in the nation.

4. Interpretation and Recommendations:

Provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis, and summarize key insights from the visualizations.

Tools and Technologies:

Power BI Desktop: For data preparation, modeling, and creating visualizations.
Excel or Power Query: For data cleaning and preprocessing if needed.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating calculated columns and measures in Power BI.

Conclusion:

The Netflix Data Analysis with Power BI project aims to provide stakeholders with interactive, visually appealing insights into user behavior and content preferences on the platform. By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, this analysis will enable better decision-making and potentially lead to improvements in content recommendation and delivery.
